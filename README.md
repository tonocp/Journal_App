# Journal_App

This is the GitHub repository for this _Journal App_ made with [VUE](https://v3.vuejs.org/), [VUE Router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/), [VUEX](https://next.vuex.vuejs.org/), [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)

With this App I can _CRUD_ daily notes with date and text, uploading an image on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and save all the data on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

It's also styled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/)

### Right now it's on DEVELOPMENT and ISN'T DEPLOYED
