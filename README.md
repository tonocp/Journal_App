# Journal_App

This is the GitHub repository for this _Journal App_ made with [VUE](https://v3.vuejs.org/), [VUE Router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/), [VUEX](https://next.vuex.vuejs.org/), [Axios](https://axios-http.com/).

With this App I can _CRUD_ daily notes with date and text, upload an image on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), even protect all entries with _User Authentication_ and save all the data of users and daily entries on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

It's made following the standards of _VUE 3_, modularized and also styled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/).

### Right now it's on DEVELOPMENT and ISN'T DEPLOYED
